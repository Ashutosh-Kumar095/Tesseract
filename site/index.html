      <h4>Linus Torvalds</h4>
      <hr>
      <div>Linus Benedict Torvalds (/ˈliːnəs ˈtɔːrvɔːldz/ LEE-nəs TOR-vawldz,[3] 
        Finland Swedish: [ˈliːnʉs ˈtuːrvɑlds] (About this soundlisten); born 28 December 1969) 
        is a Finnish-American[1][4] software engineer who is the creator and, historically, 
        the principal developer of the Linux kernel, which is the kernel for Linux operating systems
         (distributions) and other operating systems such as Android and Chrome OS. He also created 
         the distributed version control system Git and the scuba dive logging and planning software 
         Subsurface.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <div>He was honoured, along with Shinya Yamanaka, with the 2012 Millennium Technology Prize by the Technology Academy Finland "in recognition of his creation of a new open source operating system for computers leading to the widely used Linux kernel."[5] He is also the recipient
           of the 2014 IEEE Computer Society Computer Pioneer Award[6] and the 2018 IEEE Masaru 
           Ibuka Consumer Electronics Award.[7]</div>

      <h4>Life and Carrier</h4>
      <hr>
      <div>Torvalds was born in Helsinki,
         Finland, on 28 December 1969. He is the son of journalists
          Anna and Nils Torvalds,[8] and the grandson of statistician 
          Leo Törnqvist and of poet Ole Torvalds. His parents were campus radicals at the
           University of Helsinki in the 1960s. His family belongs to the Swedish-speaking minority
            in Finland. Torvalds was named after Linus Pauling, the Nobel Prize-winning American chemist,
             although in the book Rebel Code: Linux and the Open Source Revolution, Torvalds is quoted
              as saying, "I think I was named equally for Linus the Peanuts cartoon character", noting 
              that this makes him half "Nobel Prize-winning chemist" and half "blanket-carrying cartoon
               character".[9]</div>

              Torvalds attended the University of Helsinki between 1988 and 1996,[10]
               graduating with a master's degree in computer science from the NODES research group
               .[11] His academic career was interrupted after his first year of study when he joined
                the Finnish Army Uusimaa brigade, in the summer of 1989, selecting the 11-month 
                officer training program to fulfill the mandatory military service of Finland.
                 In the army he held the rank of Second Lieutenant, with the role of an artillery 
                 observer.[12] Torvalds bought computer science professor Andrew Tanenbaum's book
                  Operating Systems: Design and Implementation, in which Tanenbaum describes MINIX,
                   an educational stripped-down version of Unix. In 1990, he resumed his university 
                   studies, and was exposed to UNIX for the first time, in the form of a DEC MicroVAX 
                   running ULTRIX.[13] His MSc thesis was titled Linux: A Portable Operating System.[14]

           <div>His interest in computers began with a Commodore VIC-20,[15]
              at the age of 11 in 1981, initially programming in BASIC, but 
              later by directly accessing the 6502 CPU in machine code. He did not make
               use of assembly language.[16] After the VIC-20 he purchased a Sinclair QL,
                which he modified extensively, especially its operating system. 
                "Because it was so hard to get software for it in Finland, Linus
                 wrote his own assembler and editor (in addition to Pac-Man graphics libraries)"[17]
                  for the QL, as well as a few games.[18][19] He wrote a Pac-Man clone named Cool Man.
                   On 5 January 1991[20] he purchased an Intel 80386-based clone of IBM PC[21] before 
                   receiving his MINIX copy, which in turn enabled him to begin work on Linux.</div>

      <h4>Creating Linux</h4>
      <div>The first prototypes of Linux were publicly released later in 1991.[9][22] Version
         1.0 was released on 14 March 1994.[23]
          Torvalds first encountered the GNU Project in 1991,
           after another Swedish-speaking computer science student,
            Lars Wirzenius, took him to the University of Technology to listen to free software
             guru Richard Stallman's speech. Torvalds used Stallman's GNU General Public License 
             version 2 (GPLv2) for his Linux kernel.
          After a visit to Transmeta in late 1996,[24] Torvalds accepted a position at the 
          company in California, where he would work from February 1997 until June 2003. He then moved
           to the Open Source Development Labs, which has since merged with the Free Standards Group to
            become the Linux Foundation, under whose auspices he continues to work. In June 2004, Torvalds
             and his family moved to Dunthorpe, Oregon,[25] to be closer to the OSDL's Beaverton, 
             Oregon-based headquarters.</div>
